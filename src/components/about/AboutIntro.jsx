Hello! I'm Zillehuma, a Frontend Developer with a strong passion for building beautiful, user-focused web applications. With professional experience at companies like SA Systems, ILSA Interactive, and BizzClan, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on diverse projects ranging from real estate ERP systems to airline booking platforms and e-commerce solutions.

I specialize in modern web technologies like React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Svelte, and Iâ€™m also comfortable on the backend with Node.js and PostgreSQL. From creating responsive UI components to leading frontend features in live production environments, I love crafting clean code and elegant interfaces.

Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new frameworks, exploring UI trends, and continuously sharpening my skills through real-world projects.

    <p className="text-lg max-w-3xl mx-auto text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">

P.S. I'm currently open to exciting opportunities â€” especially remote or international roles where I can grow and contribute as part of a creative tech team.    </p>
