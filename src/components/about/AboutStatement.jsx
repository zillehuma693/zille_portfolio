      Over the past 2+ years, Iâ€™ve developed ERP platforms, booking systems, and e-commerce dashboards that are fast, responsive, and user-friendly. I love turning design into clean code and believe in shipping ahead of deadlines.
      <br /><br />
      My focus is on frontend frameworks like React and Next.js, with solid backend experience using Node.js and PostgreSQL. I'm always looking to grow and contribute to meaningful projects.
